# Avoindata subtheme

The Drupal 8 theme used at avoindata.fi is built on [Drupal Bootstrap](https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap) 8.x-3.x base theme.

## Installation

Avoindata.fi uses Ansible to move this repository in Drupal's theme folder, and Drush to enable the subtheme and set it as default theme. The code can be found at [Opendata repository](https://github.com/vrk-kpa/opendata).

## Less files

Less files in this repository are not being used. Instead, we use [ytp-assets-common](https://github.com/vrk-kpa/opendata/tree/master/modules/ytp-assets-common) for Drupal Less files.
